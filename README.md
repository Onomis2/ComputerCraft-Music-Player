# ComputerCraft-Music-Player
A simple script I made that plays .dfpwm files located on the pc

# Install guide
1. Place a pc with a speaker attached to it either directly or through modems. ~~Drives and floppy disks are a planned feature~~
2. In the placed pc run codes
   ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onomis2/ComputerCraft-Music-Player/main/startup.lua```
4. and
   ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onomis2/ComputerCraft-Music-Player/main/playMusic.lua```
6. add songs to pc ~~Drives and floppy disks are a planned feature~~

# How to get songs
Here I will show you my method. There might be easier methods out there, but this one is tested by me and proven to work.
1. Have your audio file of choice somewhere in your (real)pc.
2. Go to [ComputerCrafts file converter](https://music.madefor.cc/), drag and drop your audio and download your audio.dfpwm
3. next go to [My file to link website of choice](https://tmpfiles.org) and upload your audio.dfpwm
4. Click the generated link and copy the web address
5. in your (minecraft)pc type "wget " and paste the webaddress. It should look something like this ```wget https://tmpfiles.org/dl/1234567/youradiofile.dfpwm```
6. reboot your (minecraft)pc
# Notes
Storing and playing music from drives and floppy disks are a planned feature, just like being able to click the song you want to play instead of having to type out your songs.
